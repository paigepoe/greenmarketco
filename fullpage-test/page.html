			<p style="font-size:20px;"><b>Providing all New Yorkers with fresh healthy local and affordable produce.</b></p>
		
			<p>"Buy local" seems to be on everyone's lips and direct-to-consumer sales of agricultural products in the U.S. have increased dramatically in the past 10 years. However in spite of consumers' growing demand for locally, sustainably produced food, regional food systems often lack the infrastructure and support systems needed to move locally grown food in wholesale volumes to wholesale buyers such as food retailers, restaurants, and institutions.</p>

			<p>In response, in 2012 GrowNYC launched  <b>Greenmarket Co.</b>, New York City's first and only "food hub" dedicated to supporting regional food producers by making their products available to wholesale buyers throughout the city.</p>

		    		<p>Greenmarket Co. sources from small and mid-sized farms in the Northeast region &#45; most of our product comes from New York State, but we also purchase from farms in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Maine. Greenmarket Co.&#39;s suppliers include 300-acre vegetable farms utilizing conventional growing practices, 200-year old fruit orchards utilizing Integrated Pest Management (IPM), small, organic vegetable farms, cooperatively marketed organic grain, and bean farms, egg producers, apiaries, and dairies. Buying locally is good for everyone: the fifty-three farmers we source from have a revenue stream for their home grown product; the land they keep in production is in agricultural use &#45; not developed. Our customers can buy with confidence knowing that this is a traceable supply chain &#45; a chain with very few links, from farmer to Greenmarket Co. and then straight to your door. Your consumers will thank you for providing the freshest best tasting goods and ingredients. At Greenmarket Co. every item we sell begins with a story and that story starts with a farmer:</p>
